    <string name="strMsg">Thanks for using Towel Pie Root\nBy KrYpToNiTe!\n\n All the credit for the exploits go to Geohot and JCase not me, I only take credit for the app!\n\n 
    Without them this app would not be possible. It combines Towelroot\'s futex exploit with a modified version of PIE root\'s xbin.img mount into one app. To achieve a 
    one click untethered root for write protected devices!\n\n If you enjoyed this, please donate to Geohot at towelroot.com,
